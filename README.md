# AgentPrimer

**Automate AI Agent Instruction Generation from Code Repositories**

AgentPrimer analyzes software repositories and generates an intermediate instruction file for a coding agent to use when creating the final `agent.md`. This approach ensures robust, consistent, and high-quality results—especially for large repositories—by leveraging detailed offline analysis.

## What is `agent.md`?

`agent.md` is a file that provides instructions for AI agents to understand and interact with a software repository.

It contains information about the repository's structure, dependencies, code style, testing frameworks, and build/deployment processes. This file helps AI agents to better understand the repository's context and generate more accurate and useful code suggestions.

For more information about AI agent instructions and their role in code understanding,
see [here](https://agentsmd.net/#what-is-agentsmd).

## Why AgentPrimer?

AgentPrimer enables developers to quickly produce reliable `agent.md` instructions for AI tools, saving time and effort. It delivers consistent AI behavior tailored to each project and provides rich repository context without consuming tokens, streamlining your development workflow. Whether you’re working solo or in a team using AI coding assistants, AgentPrimer enhances productivity and code comprehension.

Give it a try and see how it can elevate your AI-driven development. If you find it helpful, don’t forget to star the repo!

## Quick Start

Run AgentPrimer from your repository’s root directory with a single command. It analyzes the repository and outputs an intermediate instruction file for a coding agent to generate the final `agent.md`. This method ensures consistent, high-quality `agent.md` creation through advanced offline analysis, even for large projects.

## Goals

- Understand repository structure comprehensively.  
- Identify internal and external libraries and dependencies.  
- Analyze code style and naming conventions.  
- Detect test frameworks and methodologies.  
- Summarize build and deployment processes.  
- Generate consistent, high-quality intermediate instructions for AI agents to produce `agent.md`.
